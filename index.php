<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p> My name is Saranya Vijayakumar. I am 17 and am a senior at Riverdale Country School in New York. Last year I took AP Computer Science where I learned Java. I also do research at Columbia where I analyzed codon ratios and energy to find statistically significant variables that affect protein expression efficiency. I use Java, awk, and Perl for this research. I taught myself HTML and CSS. I am very interested in computer science and hope to continue studying it in college.    
  
  I'm excited to be learning more about web applications! </p>
<p>I am using Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 to edit this code. </p>
